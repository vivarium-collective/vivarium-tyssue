# `uv sync` resolves the workspace's deps. `--no-install-project` avoids
# building the workspace itself as a wheel (hatchling's bypass-selection
# would no-op anyway, but skipping the step is faster); the OR fallback
# covers the case where a future workspace removes that bypass.
# Run AFTER the full COPY so [tool.uv.sources] entries that point at
# paths inside the workspace (a vendored sibling, a local sub-checkout)
# resolve. Loses some layer cache on source-only edits — acceptable
# trade-off for robustness across source types.
